The main menu has 5 functions:
  * access the settings page
  * **create a new project** this will backup the old project folder (proposing a timestamp based name to the user) and create a new clean default project folder in the sdcard
  * **load an existing project** this gives the possibility to browse the filesystem to select an existing geopaparazzi project folder (the one with the database in it) to load it
  * exit geopaparazzi
  * visualise the about page, which contains links and acknowledgements
