The measure mode disables the ability to pan the map, while it enables the possibility to draw a line on the map and measure it while dragging to draw. The approximate (the distance is calculated without considering elevation deltas) distance is shown in the upper part of the map view.

When active, the measure tool has a red colored icon, when inactive the icon is green instead.
