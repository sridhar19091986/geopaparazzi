# Notes #

Geopaparazzi supports 3 different types of notes:
  * text notes
  * picture notes
  * audio notes
  * sketch notes

To access them you can tap on the first icon of the dashboard, the **take notes** icon. Once you tap on it, a quickaction popup will appear, proposing the 3 possible options:

## Text Notes ##

By tapping on the text note action, a simple dialog will appear, in which the text note can be written. Want to save the note? Tap on the **ok** button. Want to trash it? Tap on the **cancel** button.

Remember that the position of the note is taken when the note view is opened, not closed, so you have all the time you need to insert the text.

## Picture Notes ##

Tapping on the picture note action will launch the camera application that comes with your android system. We decided to switch from our custom camera application to the default one, because it gives many more possibilities of customization of the images size, focus and so on. This has one drawback, which is the fact that we are not able to pick the azimuth of the camera shot at the exact moment it is taken. The azimuth is therefore recorded at the moment the camera application is closed.

To have a realistic azimuth, you need to take the picture and stay with the device in the same position of the snapshot until you have closed the camera app.


## Audio note ##

To enable audio recording, tap on the **blah** icon. It will start recording immediately, opening a dialog to stop recording.

## Sketch note ##

The last note is the sketch note, which allows you to draw on a small panel and save your sketch.

One can change stroke style, color, and width. Other buttons such as undo, clear, save, and share are also available.

Once the note has been saved, it can't be changed.
