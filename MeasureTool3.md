The measure mode disables the ability to pan the map, while it enables the possibility to draw a line on the map and measure it while dragging to draw. The **approximate** (the distance is calculated without considering elevation deltas and with the coordinate picking precision of a finger on a screen) distance is shown in the upper part of the map view.

When active, the measure tool has a red colored icon, when inactive the icon is green instead.
