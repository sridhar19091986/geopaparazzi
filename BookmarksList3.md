The bookmarks list shows all the saved bookmarks.

In the upper part there is a textbox that helps to filter out a particular bookmark based on its name.

You have 4 options:
  * go to the bookmark location
  * add a proximity alert. In that case a dialog opens and asks for a radius in meters to define the proximity area. Once the gps enters that area, the user will be notified
  * rename the bookmark
  * delete the bookmark
