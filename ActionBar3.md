The action bar is available both on the dashboard view and on the map view, in order to keep some of the functionalities always available.



## Gps Info ##

Starting from right to left, the first icon pops up a dialog containing information about the gps status.

It also reports whether the gps is logging or not and if it is switched on or off.

## The Compass View ##

The third icon takes the user to the compass view, which since version 2.1.0 is no longer maintained in Geopaparazzi. The compass view is borrowed from the very nice [Gps Status](http://eclipsim.com/gpsstatus/) project.

Obviously you need to have that application installed, so if it is not already installed in your system, Geopaparazzi will ask you if you want to do so and if you accept, it will take you to the market page of the Gps Status application.

## The GPS status icon ##

The last icon is the GPS status icon.

It is:
  * **RED**: if the gps is not switched on
  * **ORANGE**: if the gps is on but no fix was acquired
  * **GREEN**: if the gps is on, has fix, but is not logging
  * **BLUE**: if the gps is logging
