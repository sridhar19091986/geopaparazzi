To record gps tracks, just tap on the button on the main view.

The button will get a slight magenta color and on the compass view a vertical profile chart of the last 100 points taken is shown, as well as the number of points taken from the start of the logging and the cumulated distance (not very precise though).

Every time the logging is switched on a new track is created.
