## Notes ##

Geopaparazzi supports 3 different types of notes:
  * text notes
  * picture notes
  * audio notes

To access them you can tap on the first icon of the dashboard, the **take notes** icon. Once you tap on it, a quickaction popup will appear, proposing the 3 possible options:

## Text Notes ##

By tabbing on the text note action, a simple dialog will appear, in which the text note can be written. Want to save the noe? Tap on the **ok** button. Want to trash it? Tap on the **cancel** button.

Remember that the position of the note is taken when the note view is opened, not closed, so you have all the time you need to insert the text.

## Picture Notes ##

Tapping on the picture note action will launch the camera application that comes with your android system. We decided to switch from our custom camera application to the default one, because it gives many more possibilities of customization of the images size, focus and so on. This has one drawback, which is the fact that we are not able to pick the azimuth of the camera shot at the exact moment it is taken. The azimuth is therefor recorded at the moment the camera application is closed.

To have a realistic azimuth, you need to take the picture and stay with the device in the same position of the snapshot until you closed the camera app.


## Audio note ##

To enable audio recording, tap on the **blah** icon. It will start recording immediatly, opening a dialog to stop recording.
