# Introduction #

Below a list of pre-populated geopaparazzi databases is made available. The data are downloaded from the great [Cloudmade download area](http://downloads.cloudmade.com/). I did really nothing more than insert them into a geopaparazzi ready database.

# How to use them #

Simply click on a link, download the file, rename it to **geopaparazzi.db** and put it in your current geopaparazzi folder. It should substitute an already existing file **geopaparazzi.db**. If it doesn't, you are probably in the wrong folder.

# Currently available databases #

Check the creation date of the file to see when the data were last updated.
