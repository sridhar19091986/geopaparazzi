From the main menu it is possible to export all collected data to kmz format.
KMZ is well known as it can be visualized in the 3D viewer [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/).

In the export:
  * the notes are placed as red pins having the first letters of the text content as label
  * the images are placed as yellow pins
  * the gps logs are visualized as tracks
