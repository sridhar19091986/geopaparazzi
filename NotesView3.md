The notes list shows all the available notes.

Simple images notes are all marked as **image notes**.

In the upper part there is a textbox that helps to filter out a particular note based on its name.

You have 3 options:

  * go to the note location
  * open or edit the note. Image notes are opened and complex notes can be edited.
  * delete the note
