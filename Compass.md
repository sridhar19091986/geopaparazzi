A couple of words have to be said about the compass you see on the main view.
It was developed mainly in order to give orientation to the pictures taken, so that the pictures, when imported into BeeGIS, would visualize on the map the shooting direction, making therefore easier to interprete the survey's results.

Because of the above, the orientation axis has been transformed to be as it is pictured in the following image:

The compass therefore only shows the right direction when the device is kept in the _taking a picture_ position.

In the compass the user represents the compass needle, so it might not be completely intuitive at first to find the north. This image should help:
