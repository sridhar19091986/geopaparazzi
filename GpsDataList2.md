The gps data list shows the data surveyed, both points and tracks.

The notes are all kept inside a single layer and therefore have an own panel in the upper part. From there you can change visibility, size and color.

Below the notes panel, there is the list of recorded tracks.

It is possible to change the visibility of the single track from here, but also enter (by tapping on it) a properties panel.

From here it is possible to:
  * change the name of the track
  * change track width
  * change track color
  * chart the track
  * zoom to the first point of the log in the map view
  * remove the track
