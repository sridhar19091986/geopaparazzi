The Bookmarks are a layer on its own, that contains saved settings of the viewport.

When you add a bookmark, a small star is added on the map in the center of the screen. With the boomark, apart of the position and a title that one can give:

also the map bounds and zoom are saved. That way one can return to the scenario that the bookmark represents in any moment.
