## Where to download vector maps ##

Vector maps are kindly generated by two different sources:

  * mapsforge
  * openandmaps

### mapsforge ###

The standard maps generated, maintained and distributed by the [mapsforge](http://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/) team and downloadable from [their server](http://download.mapsforge.org/).

In their default style they kind of look like:

### openandmaps ###

[Openandromaps](http://www.openandromaps.org) generates maps following the opencycle theme, with isolines and more hiking related stuff. The map files are larger but worth every byte. Their [download area is here](http://www.openandromaps.org/en/download.html).

With the Oruxmaps theme that is available from the download area, the maps look like:

## Apply a render theme ##

Geopaparazzi applies render themes if they are found on the disk. In order to be found, the render theme xml file needs to have the same name as the map file. Ex, the above cycle map example has a:

```
italy_cycle.map
```

and a

```
italy_cicle.xml
```

render theme file in the **maps folder at the root of the sdcard**.
