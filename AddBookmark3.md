The Bookmarks are a layer on its own, that contains saved settings of the viewport.

When you add a bookmark, a small star is added on the map in the center of the screen. With the boomark, apart of the position and a title that one can give:

<p align='center'><img src='http://wiki.geopaparazzi.googlecode.com/git/images3/34_add_bookmark.png' /></p>


also the map bounds and zoom are saved. That way one can return to the scenario that the bookmark represents in any moment.

It is possible to tap on the bookmark to read its label.

See [the bookmarks list](BookmarksList3.md) section to see how to retrieve an old bookmark.
