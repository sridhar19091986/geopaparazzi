The map view visualizes an [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) map both when online (downloading new tiles) and offline (visualizing those that were cached during online mode).

The map engine comes from the [osmdroid](http://code.google.com/p/osmdroid/) project and with it a lot of features like, multitouch zooming, double tab zooming, the scalebar and the minimap window.
