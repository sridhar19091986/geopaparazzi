All the features that need to be quickly accessed, as toggling gps on and of, create a note or take a picture, as well as visualizing the current position on a map, are accessible from the main view of geopaparazzi, as can be noted in the following pictures.

The main view presents a compass and main gps information, as well as four large and easy
accessible buttons.
