We recently started to use [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com) for the translation of the geopaparazzi project.

Partecipating is quite easy. You just need to sing up and are ready to translate. Transifexsupplies some very handy and helpful tools to do so.

The [geopaparazzi project translation page is here](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/geopaparazzi/).

If you need help to setup an account and contribute, feel free to contact us in the mailinglist. We will guide you through the process.

Thanks for contributing.
