Geopaparazzi supports the import of gpx datasets, both points and tracks.

By tabbing on the **import gpx** icon, you are taken to a simple file browser.

<br>

The browser only shows folders and files with gpx extentions. Find the gpx you want to import and select it. You can then choose if you want a waypoints file to be imported as lines. This can get handy in the case of gpx downloaded for example from the <a href='http://maps.cloudmade.com/'>cloudmade maps</a> application, which exports the track as a set of waypoints. Routes and Tracks are imported as lines.<br>
<br>
A point layer also shows the description of the points, while the track does not.<br>

<br>

The file will then be imported. This might take a while for large files, so wait pateiently until the process monitor stops.<br>

When I have to travel and obviously use geopaparazzi as limited navigation tool, I love to find my track on the <a href='http://openrouteservice.org/'>Open Route Service</a>, which then has an option to download the track as gpx file.
